# 🍋🍰 Lemon Cake
A mini mobile game built with React Native featuring drag-and-drop mechanics

## About the Project

This project was developed as a practice exercise to improve skills in gesture handling, animations, layout measurement, state management, and audio integration within the React Native ecosystem. The player drags and drops various ingredients into a bowl to prepare a lemon cake. The project focuses on combining gestures and animations, which are commonly used in mobile game development.
